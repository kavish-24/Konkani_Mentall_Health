You are a strict text-matcher. Do not guess or compensate.

Goal:
Match each small segment to the exact matching text in the large transcript. 
If a segment does NOT clearly exist in the transcript, ignore it completely — do not try to estimate or improvise a match.

Output Format:
Return ONLY a CSV table (so I can save it as Excel) with columns:

file_name, matched_text

Rules:
• Only include rows where there is clear, strong text match.
• If no clear match exists, SKIP that segment (do not mention it).
• Do not add explanations.
• Do not add extra text — only plain CSV.

Segments:
